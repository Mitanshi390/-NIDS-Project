# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** leveraging machine learning techniques to detect and classify various types of cyber-attacks in network traffic. The system is designed to provide early warnings of malicious activities, ensuring secure and reliable communication across networks.

## 🎯 The Challenge
Design and implement a robust NIDS capable of:
- Analyzing network traffic data.
- Identifying and classifying different types of intrusions such as:
  - **DoS** (Denial of Service)
  - **Probe**
  - **R2L** (Remote to Local)
  - **U2R** (User to Root)
- Distinguishing between normal and abnormal traffic patterns.
- Alerting network administrators of potential security threats in real time.

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on the publicly available dataset from Kaggle:

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost – based on your implementation)
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- **Pandas / Scikit-learn / Matplotlib**: For data handling and visualization
- **IBM Cloud Lite Services**: Mandatory platform used for model deployment and analytics
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For experimentation and development
- **PowerPoint**: For project presentation (`NIDS_Project_Presentation.pptx`)

## ✅ Outcomes
- Successfully trained and evaluated a classifier capable of detecting major types of network intrusions.
- Achieved competitive accuracy on unseen data from the Kaggle dataset.
- Deployed the model using **IBM Cloud Lite** for real-time detection and alerts.

## 🔐 Importance
A functional and efficient NIDS is essential for:
- Preventing cyber threats in enterprise and public networks
- Ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Reducing the response time to cyber-attacks
